## ðŸ†• Program Developer Template

### Overview
The Program Developer template brings together four AI developers to design, implement, test, and document complete software programs through collaborative development.

### Participants

#### 1. Software Architect (Temperature: 0.4)

- Full file implementations (not snippets)
- Proper imports, error handling, and logging
- Type hints and comprehensive comments

**Communication Style**:
- **Explanations**: Minimal (1-2 sentences)
- **Code**: Comprehensive, runnable, production-quality

#### 3. Code Reviewer & Optimizer (Temperature: 0.3)
**Role**: Reviews, debugs, and optimizes code
**Deliverables**:
- Specific bug fixes with explanations
- Security vulnerability patches
- Performance optimizations
- Refactored code improvements
- Complete updated code (not just diffs)

**Communication Style**:
- **Reviews**: Focused (3-4 key points)
- **Code Fixes**: Complete, improved implementations

#### 4. Testing & Documentation Specialist (Temperature: 0.4)
**Role**: Creates comprehensive tests and documentation
**Deliverables**:
- Complete test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
- README with installation and usage
- API documentation
- Code examples and tutorials
- Deployment guides

**Communication Style**:
- **Explanations**: Brief (2-3 sentences)
- **Deliverables**: Complete, ready-to-use

### Usage Tips

1. **Initial Prompt Format**:
   ```
   Program idea/requirement: [Describe what you want to build]
   
   Example: "A Python CLI tool for managing TODO lists with categories, 
   priorities, due dates, and export to JSON/CSV. Include colored terminal 
   output and persistent storage."
   ```

2. **Development Workflow**:
   - **Round 1**: Architect designs structure and provides starter code
   - **Round 2**: Developer implements core features
   - **Round 3**: Reviewer identifies issues and optimizes
   - **Round 4**: Testing specialist adds tests and docs
   - **Rounds 5+**: Iterative enhancement and feature addition

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Let all four participants contribute before requesting changes
   - Each round builds incrementally on previous code
   - Request specific features or modules one at a time
   - Use manual mode to guide development direction

4. **Getting Complete Programs**:
   - The template is optimized for COMPLETE code output
   - Explanations are minimal to maximize code in context
   - After 4-6 rounds, you'll have a production-ready program

### Example Development Cycle

```
Round 1 (Architect):
- Project structure
- Technology choices (e.g., Click for CLI, SQLite for storage)
- Base classes and interfaces
- Starter code skeleton

Round 2 (Developer):
- Complete implementation of core features
- Full CLI commands with argparse/click
- Database operations
- Error handling

Round 3 (Reviewer):
- Security fixes (input validation, SQL injection prevention)
- Performance improvements (caching, query optimization)
- Code quality improvements (refactoring, patterns)
- Complete updated codebase

Round 4 (Testing):
- pytest test suite with fixtures
