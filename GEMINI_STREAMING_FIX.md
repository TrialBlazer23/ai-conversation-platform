# Gemini Streaming Fix - December 2024

## Issue
Gemini streaming responses were not displaying content, only showing token usage metadata.

## Root Cause
The `generate_response_stream` method in `providers/google_provider.py` was incorrectly expecting Server-Sent Events (SSE) format with `data: ` prefixes, but the Gemini API actually returns newline-delimited JSON objects.

## Solution
Updated the streaming parser to:
1. Parse each line as JSON directly (no `data: ` prefix removal)
2. Decode UTF-8 and parse JSON in one step
3. Skip invalid JSON lines gracefully
4. Extract text from the proper JSON structure

## Code Changes
**File:** `providers/google_provider.py`

**Before:**
```python
for line in response.iter_lines():
    if line:
        line = line.decode('utf-8')
        if line.startswith('data: '):  # ❌ Wrong format!
            json_str = line[6:]
            chunk_data = json.loads(json_str)
            # ... extract text
```

**After:**
```python
for line in response.iter_lines():
    if line:
        try:
            # Decode and parse JSON directly (no 'data: ' prefix)
            chunk_data = json.loads(line.decode('utf-8'))
            # ... extract text
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            continue  # Skip invalid lines
```

## Testing
- ✅ Verified with mock data that JSON parsing works correctly
- ✅ Confirmed invalid JSON lines are skipped gracefully
- ✅ Provider instantiation and attributes work as expected
- ✅ Syntax validation passes

## Impact
- **Users affected:** Anyone using Gemini models with streaming enabled
- **Severity:** High (streaming was completely broken)
- **Fix complexity:** Low (minimal code change)
- **Breaking changes:** None

## Expected Behavior After Fix
When using Gemini models with streaming enabled:
1. ✅ Content chunks appear in real-time as they're generated
2. ✅ Token usage and metadata appear at the end
3. ✅ Full response text is visible and saved to conversation
4. ✅ No more "only showing token usage" issue

## Notes
The Gemini API documentation shows that streaming responses are returned as:
- Format: Newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON)
- NOT SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- Each line is a complete JSON object

This is different from OpenAI and Anthropic APIs which use SSE format.
